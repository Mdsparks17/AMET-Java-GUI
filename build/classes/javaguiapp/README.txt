This is the Java GUI for the AMET system. This is meant to be a multi-platform replacement for the webstie that can be loaded on top of the AMET system. This application sits between the data from the database, and the R_Analysis scripts by allowing users to easily make specifications for the R Scripts. 
While this application is made specifically for the AMETf-CMAQ system, it can be easily adapted to work with other modeling systems. 
For this application to work, the same environemnt is needed as if you were just executing the R Scripts alone with Run_Info.R. This means that you must install all the required R Script dependencies and correct versioning. Try installing the packages including in the packeges.txt included in the lib folder.
